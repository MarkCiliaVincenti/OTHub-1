# Maintainers Wanted
This project is looking for maintainers.

I want to wind down my time spent on this project. I left the crypto scene about 2 years ago which took OT Hub offline and eventually I brought the website back online due to popular demand. 
OriginTrail fund the hosting on the website since bringing the website back online but I don't have any passion to continue development of the website.

If you're interested in working on OT Hub or taking over it, send me a message.

The last feature I want to finish is the Tax Report which was voted by the community in October 2021.
